C# Advent of Code
=================

Solutions in C# to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Solutions are sometimes overly complex, and sometimes more of dirty hacks. In most cases, not
much consideration was given to performance or choosing an optimal algorithm.

Solving these has been a lot of fun, and I always look forward to the next day's problem :)
